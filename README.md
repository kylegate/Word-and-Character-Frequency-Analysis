# Word-and-Character-Frequency-Analysis
This project involves implementing a C++ program to analyze a text input file and collect statistics on the frequency of words, numbers, and characters. The program identifies and counts the occurrences of each word, number, and character, and outputs the top 10 most frequently used items in each category.
